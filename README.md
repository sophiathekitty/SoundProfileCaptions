# SoundProfileCaptions

### Notes
requires [SharedVariableSaveSystem](https://github.com/sophiathekitty/SharedVariableSaveSystem)

this component/system is just a first draft. it needs to be refactored and documented. it also needs a custom editor pass to make it more user friendly.

i will also need to decided if i want to do a pass to make it work with or without [SharedVariableSaveSystem](https://github.com/sophiathekitty/SharedVariableSaveSystem). perhaps that can be it's own branch. at least till i figure out a good way to merge them together forever.

### Description
this is a system for displaying captions and storing sound effect profiles that include captions for each sound clip.
